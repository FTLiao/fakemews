## Setting up environment
To run the code successfully, one needs to install the following libraries in an virtual environment. Most importantly, to have the neural network working, one needs to have their library build around python3.

```
conda create -n testenv python=3 numpy keras pandas scipy scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel
source activate testenv
```

## Running the code 
Open the notebook to run the code

```
jupyter notebook
```
